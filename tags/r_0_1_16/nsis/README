NSIS installer for Windows
==========================

This directory contains scripts and resources for building installer for
Windows based on NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System). The make script
is provided for cross-compiling from a GNU/Linux system using mingw32 and nsis.

Requirements
------------

In addition to normal build-essential tools, GNU autotools, and pkg-config,
you will need the following packages to cross-build the installer from
GNU//Linux:

  - mingw32
  - nsis
  - tofrodos

On Debian GNU/Linux, you can just apt-get the named packages.

Building
--------

In this `installer' directory, just type:

  $ ./make-nsis

The generated installer will be libthai.v{version}.exe.

The script is actually a make file. You can see build stages in the file,
such as configure, build, install, binary.

To clean everything, for example, you can type:

  $ ./make-nsis distclean
