/**
 * @file   wtt.h
 * @brief  WTT I/O implementation
 *
 * WTT stands for Wing Tuk Tee (in Thai, Runs everywhere). It was defined by 
 * TACTIS (Thai API Consortium/Thai Industrial Standard) in the NECTEC Thai 
 * Software Standard Project (1989-1991), and later endorsed by Thai 
 * Industrial Standard Institute (TISI) as TIS 1566-2541 in 1998.
 *
 * WTT classifies Thai chracter(TIS-620) into 17 types below.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <b>ITYPE  VALUE SHORT_DESCRIPTION</b>
 * CTRL    0    control characters
 * NON     1    non composible characters
 * CONS    2    consonants
 * LV      3    leading vowels
 * FV1     4    following vowels 1
 * FV2     5    following vowels 2
 * FV3     6    following vowels 3
 * BV1     7    below vowels 1
 * BV2     8    below vowels 2
 * BD      9    below diacritics
 * TONE    10   tonemarks
 * AD1     11   above diacritics 1
 * AD2     12   above diacritics 2
 * AD3     13   above diacritics 3
 * AV1     14   above vowels 1
 * AV2     15   above vowels 2
 * AV3     16   above vowels 3
 * </pre>
 *
 * Functions in thctype.h do basic character classifications while 
 * wtt.h classifies a chracter in detail. Please refer to the reference.
 *
 * TACio_op() checks how to compose two given chracters. The possiblities are 
 * Composible (CP), Non-display (XC), Accept (AC), Reject (RJ) and Strict 
 * Reject (SR). The values of CP, XC, AC, RJ and SR are difined in wtt.h. 
 * And their meanings are:
 *
 *   @li  CP : second character is displayed in the same cell as the first, 
 *             also implies an acceptance. 
 *   @li  XC : Do nothing.
 *   @li  AC : Display second character in the next cell.
 *   @li  RJ : Discard second character.
 *   @li  SR : Reject second character only in strict mode.
 *
