    - debian/rules:
      + Replace obsoleted 'dh_clean -k' with 'dh_prep'

libthai (0.1.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move libdatrie-bin from Build-Depends-Indp to Build-Depends, as it's still
    needed by the configure script even for arch builds.

 -- Theppitak Karoonboonyanan <thep@linux.thai.net>  Thu, 07 Feb 2008 20:11:50 +0700

libthai (0.1.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add back *.la, as it still remotely enhances kdelibs via KLibLoader, which
    weirdly requires *.la to dlopen(). This is temporary support for Thai KDE
    users, until Bug #444284 is fixed, or KDE 4 enters unstable.
  * Declare libthai-dev as Enhances: kdelibs. This declaration should be moved
    to libthai0 once kdelibs 4 is fixed to load libthai.so.0 instead; or be
    removed if kdelibs is eventually built with libthai dependency.
  * debian/copyright: Rewrite in machine-interpretable format.
  * Remove XS- prefix from XS-Vcs-* fields.
  * Move Homepage info from description to control field.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no changes needed.
  * Add symbols file to provide fine-grained shlib dependency tracking
    - debian/libthai0.symbols: Added.
    - debian/control: Build-dep on debhelper (>= 5.0.61) and dpkg-dev (>=
      1.14.13) for the required dh_makeshlibs version.
  * Do not install Doxygen-generated man pages, as they aren't parsable by
    man-db. (lintian) For documentation, we already have HTML docs in
    libthai-doc.
  * debian/rules: Split build target into build-indep and build-arch.
  * debian/control: Split Build-Depends-Indep out of Build-Depends
    accordingly.
  * Fix CVSROOT in Vcs-Cvs, so it really works with debcheckout.
  * Don't ship upstream TODO (not much useful info yet).
  * Don't mention manpages in libthai-dev description, as they have been
    dropped.
  * Corrections by Paul Wise's sponsorship:
    + Do not install docs for libthai0, libthai-data.
    + Use short description for libthai-data, and add that it's usually
      auto-installed.
    + debian/libthai-doc.install, debian/libthai-doc.doc-base: Install docs
      under /usr/share/doc/libthai-doc, not libthai0-doc.
    + debian/copyright: Don't refer to file in License field.
    + debian/libthai0.symbols: Bump all symbols' minver to 0.1.7, so safer
      version is preferred, as already suggested by shlibs.
    + debian/rules:
      - Adjust config.guess, config.sub handling so the change is not included
        in .diff.gz.
      - Pass CFLAGS to configure.
